Query: "${query}"

STEP 1 - Complexity Assessment:
First determine: Does this query actually need decomposition?
- Simple, single-intent queries should NOT be decomposed
- Only decompose if the query contains 2+ distinct, separable information needs
- If query is already focused and specific, return it as-is

STEP 2 - Relevance-Filtered Decomposition:
If decomposition is needed, create subtasks that:
- Directly address the original query's core intent
- Can be answered independently with factual information  
- Are essential to answering the main question
- Avoid tangential or overly broad questions

STEP 3 - Context Preservation:
Each subtask must:
- Maintain the original query's domain/scope
- Preserve key entities and specific contexts mentioned
- Focus on actionable, researchable questions

Respond with JSON only:
{
  "needsDecomposition": true/false,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why decomposition is/isn't needed",
  "subTasks": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "query": "First essential question that directly supports the main query",
      "status": "pending",
      "relevanceScore": 0.9
    }
  ]
}

Requirements:
- Maximum 3-4 subtasks (prefer fewer when possible)
- Each subtask must have relevanceScore â‰¥ 0.8 to original query
- Eliminate questions about definitions, background, or tangential topics
- Focus on core factual needs that enable answering the original question`;

Instructions:
- Identify what might have caused the low confidence in the previous attempt

- Aim for higher confidence by being more thorough and precise
